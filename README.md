# Project 1 : Sudoku Solver  
The Sudoku  puzzle game is played on a 9 x 9 grid. Within the 
rows and columns are 9 boxes which are made up of 3 x 3 space. 
The purpose of the  puzzle is to enter a digit number from 1 to 9 
in each row & a 9 × 9 grid column without duplicating any 
numbers between the row, column or box.  
Steps to Build a Python Sudoku Solver 
1.Installing  pygame module. 
2. Import Modules- pygame and requests. 
3. Setting Pygame and Building a pygame window 
4. Making Sudoku Grid 
5. Building API 
6. Placing the elements on the board 
7. Function to check if grid position is empty or not 
8. Function for checking if the entered value is valid 
9. Solving Sudoku using a Backtracking algorithm. 
10. Quitting the game 
▪ Backtracking algorithm – solve a  Python Sudoku game 
using a backtracking algorithm. 
▪ One by one  assigning the numbers to the empty cells.  
▪ Check it before assigning that the same number is 
already present in the current row, column and box.  
▪ After that, assign the proper number using a 
recursive function to check whether it leads to the 
solution or not.  
▪ If it doesn’t lead to the solution then assign the next 
number.

# Project 2 : Temperature Converter 
This project aims to be a temperature converter for people 
living in Celsius or Fahrenheit countries. It converts the 
temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa. 
1. Required Libraries and Modules: 
▪ Tkinter Module – Tkinter Module helps to create the GUI 
window for our project. 
2. Create the GUI Window using tkinter 
3. Conversion Celsius to Farhenheit 
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32 
4. Conversion Farhenheit to Celsius 
celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9
